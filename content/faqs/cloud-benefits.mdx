question: What are the cost benefits of moving to the cloud?
answer: >
  Moving to the cloud eliminates the need for upfront hardware investments and reduces operational costs. You only pay for the resources you use, can scale resources up or down based on demand, and save on maintenance, power, and cooling expenses. Most businesses see a 20-40% reduction in IT infrastructure costs within the first year.
