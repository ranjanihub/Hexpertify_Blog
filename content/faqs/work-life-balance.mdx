question: How do I set better work-life boundaries when working remotely?
answer: >
  Create a dedicated workspace, establish fixed work hours and communicate them to your team, use separate devices for work and personal use if possible, turn off work notifications after hours, take regular breaks, schedule personal activities as seriously as work meetings, and create a end-of-day ritual to mentally transition from work mode. Remember, being available 24/7 is not sustainable and leads to burnout.
