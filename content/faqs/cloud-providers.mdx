question: Which cloud provider should I choose - AWS, Azure, or Google Cloud?
answer: >
  The choice depends on your specific needs. AWS has the largest market share and most extensive service catalog. Azure integrates well with Microsoft products and is ideal if you're already in the Microsoft ecosystem. Google Cloud excels in data analytics and machine learning. For beginners, start with whichever provider offers the best free tier for your project, then evaluate based on your actual requirements.
