question: How can I access mental health support if my company doesn't offer it?
answer: >
  Several options are available: use platforms like BetterHelp or Talkspace for online therapy, check if your health insurance covers mental health services, look for community mental health centers with sliding-scale fees, use free resources like Crisis Text Line (text HOME to 741741), join support groups, or try mental health apps like Headspace or Calm. Many therapists offer reduced rates for those without insurance.
