question: Is cloud computing secure for sensitive business data?
answer: >
  Yes, major cloud providers invest heavily in security measures that often exceed what individual companies can afford. They offer encryption at rest and in transit, multi-factor authentication, compliance certifications (SOC 2, ISO 27001, HIPAA), regular security audits, and dedicated security teams. However, security is a shared responsibility - you must still implement proper access controls and follow best practices.
