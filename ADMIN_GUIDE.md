## Security

- Session-based authentication using browser sessionStorage

## Best Practices

1. **Images**: Always use valid Pexels URLs for images
2. **Slugs**: Keep slugs short, descriptive, and URL-friendly
3. **Descriptions**: Write clear, concise descriptions (150-200 characters)
4. **Content**: Use proper MDX formatting for better readability
5. **Categories**: Choose the most relevant category for your post
6. **Publishing**: Review posts in preview mode before publishing

## Troubleshooting

### Cannot Login
- Verify you're using the correct credentials
- Clear browser cache and cookies
- Check if sessionStorage is enabled in your browser

### Posts Not Appearing
- Ensure posts are marked as "Published"
- Check if the slug is unique
- Verify the image URL is valid and accessible

### Editor Issues
- If preview doesn't update, switch tabs to refresh
- For complex formatting, check MDX syntax
- Ensure all markdown tags are properly closed
